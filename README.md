# matplotlib-challenge

Background

The skills displayed in this project include use of matplotlib, pandas, and scipy to create several plots, dataframes, summary tables, and a linear regression model. 

For this exercise I'm posing as a Senior Data Analyst for a fictional pharmaceutical company, Pymaceuticals, Inc. I've been tasked with analyzing the company's most recent animal study on squamous cell carcinoma tumor growth. The purpose of the study was to compare the performance of Pymaceutical's drug of interest, Capomulin, with other drug regimends. 

The team has tasked me with generating the necessary tables and figures for the technical report of the clinical study. Addtionally, a small analysis portion is included to give some indication on whether or not Capomulin is more effective at reducing tumor size than other drug regimens. 

The code for this project was written by myself with the help of ChatGPT where needed for syntax corrections. Those lines of code are noted by comments.
